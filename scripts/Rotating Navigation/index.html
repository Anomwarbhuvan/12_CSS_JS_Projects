            <h1>Tales of Naruto Uzumaki</h1>
            <small>Written by - Masashi Kishimoto</small>

            <p>Twelve years before the start of the series, the Nine-Tails attacked Konohagakure destroying much
                of the village and taking many lives. The leader of the village, the Fourth Hokage,
                sacrificed his life to seal the Nine-Tails into a newborn, Naruto Uzumaki. Orphaned by the attack,
                Naruto was shunned by the villagers,
                who out of fear and anger, viewed him as the Nine-Tails itself. Though the Third
                Hokage outlawed speaking about anything related to the Nine-Tails, the children — taking their cues from
                their parents
                — inherited the same animosity towards Naruto. In his thirst to be
                acknowledged, Naruto vowed he would one day become the greatest Hokage the village had ever seen.</p>

            <p>The show is split into two separate storylines:
                the original Naruto following the young ninja-in-training
                as a child, and Naruto: Shippuden picking up with his later exploits
                as a teenager. While you might think this would make it easier to digest,
                the two shows come to a whopping 720 episodes between them. To give you
                a better idea of scale, the Adult Swim anime block Toonami began airing
                Shippuden's 500 episodes on a weekly basis in 2014. They are
                scheduled to finally wrap the series in 2024.</p>
